# Myth

# for devs

## first time

You need to install all dependencies before working on the code/game

To install all dependencies (node modules) : 
```
npm install
```

## build an exe

You can build the game for a targeted platform :

Mac OS: 
```
npm run bMac
```

Windows:
```
npm run bWin
``` 

The final build should appear in the folder `../Myth/release-builds/depending_on_your_os/myth.exe or myth`
